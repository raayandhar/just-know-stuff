# just-know-stuff
Inspired by Dr. Patrick Kidger's blog on how to achieve success in a machine learning PhD: https://kidger.site/thoughts/just-know-stuff

This also includes other projects, learnings, and resources I've used. I have a full list that's relatively up-to-date with what I've completed,
with write-ups and other details here: [COMING SOON]
